# Get Started with Prebid Server
{:.no_toc}

This page has instructions for setting up Prebid.js with [Prebid Server](https://prebid.adnxs.com).

For many publishers, client-side header bidding is a balancing act between the inclusion of demand partners and impact to the page.

Using [Prebid Server](https://prebid.adnxs.com), you can move demand partners server-side, eliminating most of the latency impact that comes with adding more partners.

This should help you make more money without sacrificing user experience.

**Prebid Server is open source!**  
Prebid Server is an open source project.  [The source code is hosted under the Prebid organization on Github](https://github.com/prebid/prebid-server).
